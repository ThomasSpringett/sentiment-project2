    "Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.\n",

You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '**TODO**' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app."

Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently.

We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.\n",

    "## Step 6: Deploy the model for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the `model_fn()` method from the `train.py` file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, `if __name__ == '__main__':` )\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until *you* shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.\n",
